# Portfolio-Project
This project is to build a website of a design mockup using HTML and CSS.

# Design :
#### Required Elements:
The page at minimum includes all of the following:
- at least 4 images
- title text (h1, h2, etc.)
- regular (paragraph) text
- a logo.

#### Semantic HTML:
- HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.
- No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a CSS class or id.
- Check out the W3C documentation on [HTML Structural Elements](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_structural_elements) to learn more!

#### Custom Design:
Provide at least one of the following customizations:
- Customize images and text.
- Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with `HTML`, `CSS` or both.
- Customize `CSS` styles applied at minimum to paragraph and heading elements.

#### Grid-Based Layout:
Page utilizes a grid-based layout with styles making use of the `flexbox` layout or a framework like `Bootstrap`, `Foundation`, etc. 

If you're using `Bootstrap` or standard `HMTL/CSS`: the rows and columns of the grid must be wrapped in an element with a `container` class.
